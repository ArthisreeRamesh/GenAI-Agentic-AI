            "2. **Long-term Contracts**: B2B relationships often lead to long-term contracts, which can provide us with a more stable revenue stream compared to B2C, where customer acquisition can be more volatile.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Scalability**: By focusing on B2B, we can scale our offerings more effectively. Once we establish a relationship with a company, we can offer additional courses or services, creating upsell opportunities.\n",

            "4. **Customization**: Businesses often require customized training solutions. This allows us to differentiate our offerings and potentially charge a premium for tailored content that meets their specific needs.\n",

            "5. **Networking Opportunities**: Working with businesses can open doors to partnerships and collaborations that can enhance our brand and reach.\n",

            "\n",
            "2. **Marketing Strategy**: Our marketing approach will need to shift significantly. We’ll need to focus on building relationships and demonstrating ROI to decision-makers in organizations.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Competition**: The B2B space for project management training is competitive. We need to ensure our offerings stand out and provide clear value.\n",

This will help us build trust and shorten the sales cycle. Additionally, we can leverage case studies and testimonials from existing clients to demonstrate our value proposition.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Marketing Strategy**: \n",
            "   - **Solution**: We should develop a content marketing strategy that focuses on thought leadership in project management. This could include whitepapers, webinars, and industry reports that showcase our expertise. We can also utilize LinkedIn and other professional networks to reach decision-makers directly. Building relationships through networking events and industry conferences will also be crucial.\n",

            "- The code does not explicitly mention the removal of images, but since it focuses on text content, it implicitly achieves this by not including image tags in the output.\n",
