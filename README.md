# GenAI-Agentic-AI
This repository brings together practical, real-world projects in Generative AI and Agentic AI. It’s designed to help you understand how modern AI systems work and how to build them in a clean, production-ready way.

Inside the repo, you’ll find:

RAG pipelines — from simple implementations to advanced setups like multimodal and graph-based RAG.

Agentic workflows — agents that can use tools, plan tasks, store memory, and evaluate their outputs.

Prompt engineering templates — reusable patterns for creating reliable and structured prompts.

Evaluation frameworks — hallucination checks, faithfulness scoring, GEval metrics, and more.
